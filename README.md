`percent-bachelors-degrees-women-usa.csv` Original data released by [The Department of Education Statistics](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/2013menu_tables.asp).
Randal Olson cleaned the data set and made it available on his personal website. You can download the dataset Randal compiled [here](http://www.randalolson.com/wp-content/uploads/percent-bachelors-degrees-women-usa.csv).
